                <p>Hi, My name is Kim Boggs, and I'm totally new to this. It has been like trying to learn a new language from listening to other people speak 
                    it which is not an easy task when you've always been a hands on learner. But I'm gradually getting the hang of it, I think..LOL.
                    I started in this because after raising 4 children and 5 grandchildren, 3 of which I am still currently raising, I need a job.
                    I thought this would be very interesting and hopefully lucrative!! I have enjoyed the Web Development on Free Code Camp the most. 
                    I love the creative side of all of this. So thankful for this opportunity.
